## 11/5/2025 - Started with the schematic  

I got info about the Si4844 a long time ago so today I got the Datasheet and followed the basic schematic that was given to draw one for my own project
I still need to do some more stuff in the schematic

## 11/6/2025 - Did the basic part of PCB  

This is an RF pcb which I haven't designed any
So I did the basic placement of components that I think are right

Gonna ask an engineer to take a look later![Screenshot 2025-11-06 204820](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODg2NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--49bf1e5a91dfa317d84873c7f1d29fa08adf7ed8/Screenshot%202025-11-06%20204820.png)
