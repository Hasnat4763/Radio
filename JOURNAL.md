## 11/5/2025 - Started with the schematic  

I got info about the Si4844 a long time ago so today I got the Datasheet and followed the basic schematic that was given to draw one for my own project
I still need to do some more stuff in the schematic

## 11/6/2025 - Did the basic part of PCB  

This is an RF pcb which I haven't designed any
So I did the basic placement of components that I think are right

Gonna ask an engineer to take a look later![Screenshot 2025-11-06 204820](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODg2NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--49bf1e5a91dfa317d84873c7f1d29fa08adf7ed8/Screenshot%202025-11-06%20204820.png)
  

## 11/10/2025 10 AM - Made the PCB a bit compact  

I saw there was more space so I put the components a bit together but still far away from each other to counter noises from the digital circuits
I also changed the potentiometer footprint to a horizontal one![Screenshot 2025-11-10 105518](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTk2MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--96384f8e8f2bf5465e673b5d67198c4ba00426a9/Screenshot%202025-11-10%20105518.png)

Also increased power trace width to 0.4mm and increased the area below where I will glue the ferrite antenna

I was also busy with siege project so this journal is containing stuff I did in multiple days

Will start working on the case soon  

## 11/10/2025 9 PM - Reduced PCB Size  

I reduced the size from around 60 x 180 mm to 55 x 65 mm
I had a lot of free space so souptik suggested to reduced the size
he was insisting on reducing it to 30x30
